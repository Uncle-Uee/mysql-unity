# MySQL Unity
Getting MySQL to work with Unity using ODBC or the MySQL .Net Connector plugin.

The ODBC and MySQL .Net Connector Plugins have been tested with a local MAMP server.

If you can, try and setup a REST API that can perform your CRUD operations on your Database for you.
Then use UnityWebRequest to connect your Project to your Database via the REST API.

# Understanding the Issue
To understand the issue, please read the answer given by [peacemaker](https://answers.unity.com/questions/1785533/unity-and-mysql-connector.html).

# Included in this Project
I have included the required MySQL .Net Connector Plugins for Unity 2021.3 (v4.5.2 and v4.8) <br/>
and Unity 2020.3.30 (v4.5) as well as 2 example scripts that can be used to test a connection to your MySQL Database. <br/>

**I have tested this Project with local MAMP server.**

## Plugins
Please delete the already extracted v4.5 plugin if you wish to use an updated version of the plugin.

For Unity 2020.3 and Possibly Older version of Unity extract the following version of the MySQL .Net Connector Plugin
- Plugins
  - MySQL
    - Unity-2020
      - v4.5

For Unity 2021.3 and Possibly Newer versions of Unity extract the following version of the MySQL .Net Connector Plugin
- Plugin
  - MySQL
    - Unity-2020
      - v4.5, or
    - Unity-2021
        - v4.5.2, or
        - v4.8
    

## Scripts
The Project also includes 2 examples found in the Scripts folder.
   - MySQL
     - DatabaseManager.cs
   - ODBC
     - DatabaseManager.cs

# Manual Setup for Unity
## Setup - ODBC
1. Download ODBC Driver [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/).
2. Install the ODBC Driver.
3. Find the ODBC Driver name
   1. Open Start Menu
   2. In Windows 10 search for Administrator Tools, in Windows 11 open Run and search for "control admintools"
   4. Open ODBC Data Sources 64bit
   5. Click Add
   6. Copy the Driver name of the Driver that you see, for example mine says “MySQL ODBC 8.0 Unicode Driver”
4. Using MAMP, XAMPP, MySQL Server or whatever MySQL instance you have available
   1. Create a Database called test
   2. Create a table in that database, and name it whatever you want.
5. Open Unity
   1. Create a Script called DatabaseManager
   2. Overwrite it with the following code - **update the script with your connection information**
   3. For connection examples please have a look [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-odbc/en/connector-odbc-examples-programming-net-csharp.html)

       ```csharp
       public class DatabaseManager : MonoBehaviour
       {
           #region VARIABLES
       
           [Header("Connection Properties")]
           public string Host = "localhost";
           public string Port = "3306";
           public string User = "root";
           public string Password = "root";
           public string Database = "test";
       
           #endregion
       
           #region UNITY METHODS
       
           private void Start()
           {
               Connect();
           }
       
           #endregion
       
           #region METHODS
       
           private void Connect()
           {
               try
               {
                   string connectionString = "DRIVER={MySQL ODBC 8.0 Unicode Driver};" +
                                             $"SERVER={Host};" +
                                             $"PORT={Port};" +
                                             $"DATABASE={Database};" +
                                             $"UID={User};" +
                                             $"PWD={Password};";
                   using (OdbcConnection connection = new OdbcConnection(connectionString))
                   {
                       connection.Open();
                       print("ODBC - Opened Connection");
                   }
               }
               catch (OdbcException exception)
               {
                   print(exception.Message);
               }
           }
       
           #endregion
       }
       ```

   4. Attach the script to an Object.
   5. Press Play, you should get a log message that says “Open Connection”.
6. Start Scripting your SQL Queries


## Setup - MySQL .NET Connector Plugin
### Notes
- For Unity 2021.3 the working and tested version for the MySQL .Net Connector Plugin is v8.0.28
- From the tests I have done, it seems that newer versions of Unity support older versions of the .Net Connector Plugin (v6.9.11).
   - The versions of the .Net Connector Plugin that was tested in Unity 2021.3 was v4.5, v4.5.2 and v4.8, all 3 work!
     - MySQL .Net Connector Plugin v6.9.11
       - Extract v4.x - delete everything except the MySql.Data.dll file
     - MySQL .Net Connector Plugin v8.0.28
       - Extract v4.5.2 - delete the MySql.Data.EntityFrameWork.dll and .xml including the MySql.Web.dll and .xml files
       - Extract v4.8 - delete the MySql.Web.dll and .xml files


- For Unity 2020.3.30 and possibly older (until LTS 2019), the working and tested version for MySQL .Net Connector Plugin is v6.9.11
   - The .Net plugin that was tested in Unity 2020.3.30 was v4.0 and v4.5, both work!
      - Extract v4.x - delete everything except the MySql.Data.dll file


- If the MySQL plugin v6.9.11 does not work for your version of Unity (older than Unity 2020), <br/> 
then download an older version of the MySQL .Net Connector Plugin.<br/>
Try v6.9.5 as suggested in the Unity answer under the heading [Understanding the Issue](https://answers.unity.com/questions/1785533/unity-and-mysql-connector.html).

### Setup
1. Find the .NET Connector Plugin [here](https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/c-net/)
